# ReadMe Generator

## Description
In this project, the user is able to create a brand new, customizable readme.md file for any project they are creating!
Simply run node on the 'index.js' of the cloned repository from my (Jordan Lopez) repo, answer a few of the prompts and then your file will be generated!


## Installation
1: Clone my repository to your computer, 2: change directory into that readMeGenerator repository, run `node index.js` in your command line and that's all!
